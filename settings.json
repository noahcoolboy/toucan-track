    /* FILTERING OPTIONS

        Each filter value must contain a be null or an object 
        If it's an object, it must contain a "type" property.
        The "type" property must be one of: "Raw", "MovingAverage", "OneEuro".

        If set to null, or type is set to raw, no filter will be applied.
        The raw data will be used. This may cause jitter.

        if type is set to "MovingAverage", the filter will use the
        "window_size" property to determine the size of the window.
        A greater window_size means less jitter, but more latency.
        - "window_size" must be an integer greater than 0. (default: 5)

        if type is set to "OneEuro", the filter will use the
        "mincutoff", "beta", and "dcutoff" properties to determine
        the filter parameters.
        - "mincutoff" must be a float greater than 0. (default: 0.05)
        - "beta" must be a float greater than 0. (default: 80.0)
        - "dcutoff" must be a float greater than 0. (default: 1.0)
